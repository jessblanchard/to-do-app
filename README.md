# To Do App

The To Do App was an opportunity to us DOM Scripting to trigger responses and interact with users. 

# Development Challenges

This exercise challenged me to learn to look at and manipulate the HTML in a new way. Ajusting my perspective of HTML to realize its capacity to be responsive through DOM scripting was not so much a challenge as an opportunity to grow my tool kit. 

# Next Steps

This project is complete and no further work is planned.
